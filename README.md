# StickDice
A quick n' dirty 2d6 rolling application for the M5StickC, using the accelerometer for deep sleep wakeup. Shake the device to roll, or press the top button when it's on to roll. Press the side button to view previous rolls.

I needed something since my Catan dice seemed to be rolling more 8's than 6's, so here it is :)
